# Micro benchmark workloads
A blockchain system comprises multiple layers, and each layer may have different impact on the overall performance.
We provide some workloads to stress the layers in order to understand their individual performance.

## Workloads
* Data model layer - IOHeavy
  * [IOHeavy](ioheavy/README.md) workload description.
  
* Execution layer - CPUHeavy
  * [CPUHeavy](cpuheavy/README.md) workload description.

# The original source code of there workloads are found in https://github.com/wshbair/blockbench
